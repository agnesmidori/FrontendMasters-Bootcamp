<!-- If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities. Include:
    What is this hobby exactly?
    How does it make you feel?
    Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?
    Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action
    Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do
    If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar. -->

    <h2>Benefits of Hobbies </h2>

    <p>I think all hobbies involves feelings and what is the most fun for me in reading is that I can experience emotions without really living the story told and the same is for movies.</p>
    <p>Besides, I can take some lessons from both pratices too.</p>
    <p>With music, I can "release", "aliviate", "enjoy" what's the feeling in my heart in the moment, and it could be fun, passion, saddness, anger... Sometimes it also helps me to go through a difficult moment or motivate me to do some outdoor exercises.</p>
    <p>Speaking about outdoor exercises, it makes me feel free and all kind of landscapes fill my eyes and complete my soul.
    <p>But above all these hobbies, studying is actually my number one practicing at the moment because I'm on an IT degree course and it needs a lot of coding practice and reading concepts. But since I'm a self-taught person, I really enjoy it.</p>
